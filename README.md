# Hi, There 👋

🎓 Student | 🛡️ Cybersecurity Learner | 💻 Builder-in-Progress

I’m a student diving deep into **cybersecurity**, learning how systems break, how attackers think, and how defenses are built.  
Currently **getting cooked daily by bugs, configs, terminals, and reality** — but learning something new every time.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Learning
- 🔐 Cybersecurity fundamentals
- 🐍 Python for scripting & automation
- 🐚 Bash & Linux internals
- 🌐 Web security (how things get hacked 👀)
- 🧩 Reverse thinking, not just coding

---

## 🛠️ What I Like Working With
- Fast & minimal tools
- Lightweight code editors
- Terminal-based workflows
- Breaking things to understand them
- Building stuff *for myself*, not just tutorials

---

## 🎯 Current Goals
- Become strong in **offensive & defensive security**
- Build my **own tools & editors** for learning
- Understand systems at a **low level**
- Stop getting cooked (optional, learning is mandatory)

---

## ⚡ Philosophy
> Learn by doing.  
> Fail fast.  
> Fix faster.  
> Repeat.

---

## 🚧 Status
Still learning. Still experimenting.  
Not an expert — **yet**.

If you’re into cybersecurity, tooling, or minimal setups — welcome 👋
