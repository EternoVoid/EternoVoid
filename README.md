# 👋 Hi there

🎓 Student | 🛡️ Cybersecurity learner

Learning cybersecurity by **breaking things and getting cooked daily** — bugs, terminals, configs, all of it.

🔹 Python, Bash, Linux  
🔹 Web & system security  
🔹 Fast, minimal tools  

🎯 Goal: build strong fundamentals, create my own tools, and actually understand how systems work.

> Still learning. Still experimenting.
